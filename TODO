TODO
====

* Verify that all elements support discontinuities.
* Verify that all elements support gaps.
* Divide the gstlal_inspiral pipeline into reusable components, e.g. bins.
* Add the "restrict" keyword wherever possible in C code.


lal
===

* Add gap support to lal_whiten.
* Factor chi square calculation out of lal_triggergen.
* Backport the new time-symmetric trigger algorithm from s6online to master.
* Add support for partial coincidences (coincidences in which not all detectors
  participate) to lal_skymap.
* Come up with a trigger format that is less inspiral-centric so that all
  transient searches can share some common elements for trigger I/O, coincidence,
  and Bayesian localization.


cairovis
========

* Add direct output to png, pdf, etc.
* Add timestamps to axes
* Add colorbar
