* Verify that all elements support discontinuities.

* Verify that all elements support gaps.

* Add programmable data quality mask support to lal_onlinehoftsrc: if data
  quality vector does not satisfy a user-specified bitmask, a gap should be
  inserted.

* The orthogonal SNR gate trigger rate is way too high; the requested false
  alarm probability results in a threshold that does not divide the orthogonal
  SNR signal distribution correctly.  Find out why.

* Divide the gstlal_inspiral pipeline into smaller reusable components,
  possibly creating new element classes in Python.

* Add the ability to pre-compute the SVD and load it from a file.

* Add base classes for Matplotlib-based visualization elements.

* Make first-class element plugins for commonly used visualization elements.

* Add the "restrict" keyword wherever possible in C code.
