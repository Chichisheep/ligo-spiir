General
=======

* Verify that all elements support discontinuities.
* Verify that all elements support gaps.


Plugins/elements to hand over to GStreamer
==========================================

* ``lal_gate`` element
* ``lal_reblock`` element
* ``lal_adder`` element: make the stock ``adder`` synchronous, or figure out how to use it
* ``lal_firbank`` element
* ``lal_matrixmixer`` element
* ``lal_nxydump`` element


Streaming with gstreamer
============================

* Figure out how to do live streaming through web (pcdev1 or ATLAS) of a OmegaGram  movie

Immediate development tasks in no particular order
==================================================

* Incorporate bank veto
* add to the gstlal summary page
  * population statement plot
  * plots showing likelihood distributions and background pdfs, etc.
  * histograms for injection accuracy
* inspiral DAGs:
  * try to get it to do something sane on 1 core?
  * give jobs human-readable names
  * add data pre-staging and serial processing of banks in offline DAG
  * calc_likelihood command lines are too long:  use caches of likelihood files
* finish turning the appropriate bits of the Data class into a pipeline
handler, and get the input and output segments recorded correctly
* block diagonal matrix support to reduce number of threads
* fix known gstreamer bugs:
  * small gaps crash resampler,
  * audiofirfilter has "timestamp" bugs (?),
  * funnel won't work in time-ordered mode,
* fix known gstlal bugs:
  * compute strain in ER3 revealed bugs in something, can't remember what,
    has fallen off radar.
* framecpp demuxer and muxer cannot decode/encode gaps using "DataValid"
bit vector stream.  figure out how and fix.  (probably required to
implement offline pipeline's data staging, maybe not)
* framecpp demuxer and muxer cannot decode/encode FrHistory objects.
figure out how and fix.  (will be required for calibration work, not
required for inspiral search)
* fix service discovery to allow more than one job to be running on the
same computer and remove need for URL dump files to be exchanged via
filesystem.
* complete port to swig bindings (long term, divest ourselves of pylal).
* separate likelihood code from burst pipelines.
* fix the numerator in the likelihood ratio ranking statistic to account
for inter-instrument correlations in signal parameters (my student's
work on implementing the rate estimation code might have turned up some
code that'll do a good brute-force job of this).
* switch online code to framexmitsrc (after framexmitsrc is made to not jam up when data stops flowing)
* review readiness:  remove dead code, create tests for elements, create
validation tests for applications.
* incorporate rate estimation code into pipeline (have student working
on this)
* merge fake data generation programs into one

Completed tasks
* sub-sample interpolation of triggers (done 2013-06-06)
* have offline dag split output across multiple directories (done 2013-06-06)
