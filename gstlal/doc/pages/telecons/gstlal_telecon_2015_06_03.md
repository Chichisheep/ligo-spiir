   - First email

		Hello All,

		I began the process of organizing documentation for the review. As of right now I have diffs prepared for the reviewers of previously reviewed programs against the June 1, 2015 version of master.

		Here is a link to the code review page

		https://ldas-jobs.cgca.uwm.edu/~gstlalcbc/ryan/public_html/doc/gstlal-0.9.0/html/gstlal_review_codes_page.html

		If you were to follow one of the links on that page, e.g. reference_psd.py, then you'd find a page similar to this

		https://ldas-jobs.cgca.uwm.edu/~gstlalcbc/ryan/public_html/doc/gstlal-0.9.0/html/reference__psd_8py.html

		I created a new table with three columns, one for the most recent review hash, one for a more current hash (yesterday's master hash), and one for the diff between them. There is a link in the third column for the diff which for reference_psd.py looks like this 

		https://ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu/cgit/gstlal/diff/gstlal/python/reference_psd.py?id=7b3f86edc39628501210f18987b6a4a9367142a2&id2=b3ef077fe87b597578000f140e4aa780f3a227aa

		Please let me know if you like this organization or if you would like to see something improved/changed. If everyone is ok with this setup, then I will begin pushing these changes.

   - Second email

		Hello All,

		I have begun the process of consolidating all of the action items into a single webpage. I also commented out the action items in the meetings and telecon pages so that there is only one copy. I haven't had a chance to go through the list to see if any of these items have since been completed (please let me know if they have).

		The gstlal review page now has a link to an action item page under the links section

		https://ldas-jobs.cgca.uwm.edu/~gstlalcbc/ryan/public_html/doc/gstlal-0.9.0/html/gstlal_review_main_page.html

		where the action item link takes you here

		https://ldas-jobs.cgca.uwm.edu/~gstlalcbc/ryan/public_html/doc/gstlal-0.9.0/html/gstlalactionitemspage.html

		Please let me know what opinions you have and if this is a change everyone would like to see.
