 - UTCToGPS Bug Status (Cody)
   - PR: https://bugs.ligo.org/redmine/issues/1916
 - Software injections online: https://bugs.ligo.org/redmine/issues/2018
   - Need to get software injections flowing at UWM, questions.
     - Proposed for now, BNS only no spin, tight mass range around 1.3-1.5,
       Linear distance from 1/10th the horizon distance to 2 times the horizon
       distance. 1/60s?  Can gracedb take this rate?
     - Do we need to set an injection bit mask?
     - Do we have a specific group or type to upload results to gracedb, or will there be a separate database? What will need to change in the gstlal_inspiral pipeline?
     - Do we have volunteers to work on dynamic reporting pages that provide, e.g.,
       - Missed found plots (will require connection to seg db I guess, will require having "missed" injections represented in gracedb)
       - VT vs FAR (or range vs FAR)
       - Other summary information to compare with background, e.g., \$\chi^2\$ plots, etc.
     - Will we run (most) of gdb procesor on these events?
 - Planning review
