- Note reorganization of the \ref gstlal_review_main_page
- There is now a new action items page: \ref gstlalactionitemspage
	- <b>ACTIONS</b>
		-# Look over action items and decide what is still relevant.  If possible cast actions in the context of the S6 replay or BNS comparison MDC.  Fix the page to reflect the plan going forward.
		-# look at the code review page \ref gstlal_review_codes_page.  Assess what codes are not yet reviewed and put in place a plan to review them offline
		-# Look at the diffs of reviewed code against master.  Ryan Everett has made this easy by including a cgit diff from the latest review hash in each table, e.g., reference_psd.py Update the review status to reflect the current hash if satisfied with the changes (or if there are no changes)
- The S6 replay is now 7+ days underway \ref gstlalinspirals6replaypage
	- <b>ACTIONS</b>
		-# Look over these results and figure out how they are most useful for the review
