\section minutes Minutes

<!---
Actions
- Now that everyone is an expert on how to run gstlal_fake_frames how about the following: each reviewer take a usage case from the gstlal_fake_frames documentation
 - Sathya: Usage case 1
 - Jolien: Usage case 2
 - Duncan: Usage case 3
 - Florent: Usage case 4
- each person should run the case and use the information in the "Debug" section of the documentation to write out the pipeline.  Also, try making plots of the output, etc.  Examine it critically and figure out what questions you have and what you would like to see answered in order to validate each piece.  We will go over each case next week.
- I hope this leads to a systematic plan to review each element and document the review of each element, etc in a coherent way.
