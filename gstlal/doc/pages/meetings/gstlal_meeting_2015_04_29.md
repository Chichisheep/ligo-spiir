 - What will we do for the F2F?
   - A proposal by Chad:  I would like to review team to work towards getting the ER7 analysis prepared and reviewed. I think we can use the S6 replay data to set it up.  There will be a lot of local expertise at UWM to make it happen. By the end of the week I would like to strive to have the review team generally happy with the ER7 plan.
