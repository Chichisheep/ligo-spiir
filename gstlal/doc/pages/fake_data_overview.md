## Introduction

gstlal provides several tools for producing fake gravitational wave data for
the purpose of simulating various scenarios.  This page works through several
examples starting with simple command line data generation, working up to
Condor DAGs that can generate months of fake data suitable for MDC studies.

## Basic LIGO/ALIGO colored Gaussian noise on the command line

## Custom colored noise, i.e. make your own detector

## Simulating signals on the command line

## Recoloring existing data with a HTCondor dag
