\page gstlal_review_howto_page Review How To Page

Here is a basic guide to adding minutes.  Hopefully folks can extrapolate from
there and add documentation to this page when they learn something new

-# Check out the git repo 
-# Add a page, e.g, gstlal/gstlal/doc/pages/review/gstlal_meeting_2014_10_22.md with the date changed, of course.
-# Make sure to add an appropriate page tag and title at the top, e.g., "\page gstlalmeeting20141022page Review Meeting October 22, 2014"
-# follow the doxygen rules for making a markdown page
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/markdown.html
-# Code stuff, e.g., gstlal_inspiral should be automatically linked, but you
will need to link other things with the "\ref" command
