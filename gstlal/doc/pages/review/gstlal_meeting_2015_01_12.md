\section agenda Agenda

  - Look at MDC results for BNS
    - https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/ligovirgo/cbcnote/BNS/MDC/SpinMDC/gstlal_pipe_compare
  - Look at S6-replay
  - Run pipeline tutorial

\section action Action Items

  - Compute the actual expected SNR (instead of from average PSD) and plot the SNR histograms again
  - We should compare the on-line and off-line results and understand the similarities and differences
  - Figure out why multiple low-SNR events get the same likelihood (these constitute about a quarter of all events)
  - Summary pages: Zoomed versions for accuracy plots
  - Summary pages: Histogram of accuracies
  - Summary pages: Make accuracy plots as a function of FAR 
  - Summary pages: Plot accuracy as a function of SNR
  - Summary pages: Injections are found with "pi" time-shift; probably coming from one time-slide (check and fix)
  - Summary pages: What is the reason for close-by missed injections in missed-found plot (as a function of Mchirp)?
