Notes:

- We might not need to review gstreamer elements
- Sathya wants to see the review lead to broader use of gstlal
- Kipp suggest that although we may have a specific task (e.g. review gracedb events as "the" final product) we will review a lot of stuff used for other purposes.
- Start by looking at fake data generation
