These are instructions to get gstlal and gstlal-ugly installed on LDG machines.

You always have to setup your environment to use the correct gstlal / lalsuite
code.  Probably there will eventually be a tag.  Something like this should be
done.  

1) Disable the lscsoft installation (to make sure you have a clean slate).
Also make sure you don't have anything unusual (including other
lalsuite/gstlal/gstreamer installations) set up by default at login.

 $ touch .nolscsoft

2) Only a few variables need to be set. Here you will setup only the lscsoft
packages that you need.  I build lalsuite and gstlal to a directory called
gstlocal, with _no_ subdirectories.  You should do whatever you are comfortable
with, but I highly recommend simplicity. For comparison here is my environment
script:

________________________________________________________________________________________________
for p in libframe gst libmetaio
       do
       PATH=/opt/lscsoft/${p}/bin:$PATH
       PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/lscsoft/${p}/lib64/pkgconfig:/opt/lscsoft/${p}/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
       PYTHONPATH=/opt/lscsoft/${p}/lib64/python2.4/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
       done

# This is an install prefix that does not get used anywhere but this script!!!
INSTALLPATH=${HOME}/gstlocal

# These are environment variables that do get exported
PATH=${INSTALLPATH}/bin:$PATH
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${INSTALLPATH}/lib64/pkgconfig:${INSTALLPATH}/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
PYTHONPATH=${INSTALLPATH}/lib64/python2.4/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
GST_PLUGIN_PATH=${INSTALLPATH}/lib/gstreamer-0.10:${GST_PLUGIN_PATH}
source ~cbc/opt/sqlite/etc/sqliterc

export PATH PKG_CONFIG_PATH PYTHONPATH GST_PLUGIN_PATH

3) Clone the repositories if you don't have them already
 $ git clone albert.einstein@ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu:/usr/local/git/gstlal.git
 $ git clone albert.einstein@ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu:/usr/local/git/lalsuite.git

4) build lalsuite to the prefix you used in your environment script!!

5) cd into gstlal and build to the same prefix.

6) cd into gstlal-ugly and build to the same prefix.
