## @file gstlal_inspiral_marginalize_likelihoods_online
#
# This program runs gstlal_inspiral_marginalize_likelihood in a while True
# loop; See gstlal_inspiral_marginalize_likelihoods_online for more details

## @package gstlal_inspiral_marginalize_likelihoods_online
#
# This program is not meant to be executed standalone by a user. It should be
# part of a DAG managing a running gstlal_inspiral online analysis.
#
# This program takes two arguments;
#
# - The path to the registry txt files that it will use to figure out the nodes
#   of the running jobs
# - The output file name
#
# This program queries each running gstlal_inspiral job via the URL recorded in
# its registry file and computes the marginalized likelihood distribution used
# for computing the false-alarm-probability.
#
# It continues to do that in a while True loop (with a 10 minute break).  Files
# are not overwritten directly, but rather via a temporary file and mv
# operation to ensure that no files are corrupted in a POSIX file environment.
#
