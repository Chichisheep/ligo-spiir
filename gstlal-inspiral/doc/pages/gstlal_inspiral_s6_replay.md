\section Introduction Introduction

With O1 quickly approaching in mid to late 2015, the CBC group is doing a live data simulation run using S6 data to test various piplines for the purpose of code review.  This documentation page is specific to the gstlal portion of the simulation run.  

\section Proposal Proposed Approach

The gstlal development team proposes to start the process by first testing the current code releases.  Once these are working, the team can move forward with getting the current development code suitable for a new release.  This new release can be used for the actual S6 MDC, and then to get the project to the NSF mandated benchmarking for HW3.

\section Gantt Gantt Chart

The following gantt chart is a proposed schedule of schedule of tasks for the gstlal development team.  Lengths of tasks are only estimates, and may change based on team members availabilities.  Note that the benchmarking for HW3 does not have an estimated end date.
