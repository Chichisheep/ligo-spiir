Here is how this works.  Each directory does a small bit of the PBH analysis.  It is assumed that you will copy this directory to somewhere first.

here is what I might do from this directory:

$ cp -r . ${HOME}/PBH_TEST
$ cd ${HOME}/PBH_TEST

You should start by creating the relevant segments for the run.  This includes generating software injections if you plan to do them

$ cd segments

if you want to
