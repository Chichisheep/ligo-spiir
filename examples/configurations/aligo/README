=======================
DAG generator for LLOID
=======================

No time slides, no coincidence.
Designed to assess sensitivity in colored Gaussian noise.


Instructions
============

To build and submit a DAG:

 1. Make sure lalsuite and gstlal are in your environment.

 2. Set the environment variable TMPDIR to point to a directory that is not
    NFS mounted but exists on all of the nodes in the cluster.  For example, at
    CIT I would type::

	  $ export TMPDIR=/usr1/$(USER)

 3. Grab some mock h(t).  On CIT, you can just symlink this into place::
    
	  $ ln -s ~lsinger/mock_aligo_hoft hoft

 4. Run make to generate a template bank, a PSD estimate, and a DAG:
 
      $ make -j

 5. Submit the DAG::
     
	 $ condor_submit_dag aligo.dag
