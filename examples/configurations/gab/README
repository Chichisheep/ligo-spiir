===========================
GAB: GStreamer Audio Bridge
===========================

Provides live audio from instrumental channels at LIGO observatories.

Includes a lightweight RealTime Streaming Protocol (RTSP) server powered
by GStreamer.  Audio streams should be compatible with Totem, QuickTime Player,
Windows Media Player, and other popular media player apps.

A web page providing a list of links to available channels is provided by a
lightweight HTTP server written in Python.

Instructions
------------

1. Run ``make`` in this directory to build the native C component.
2. Run ``gab`` in this directory to start the server, pointing it at an NDS1
   or NDS2 server::

   $ ./gstlal_gab --host marble.ligo-wa.caltech.edu --port 31200

3. Open a web browser and go to <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Click any link to open an audio stream in your media player.

I have tested this with QuickTime Player on Mac OS, but it should also work with
Totem on Linux and Windows Media Player on Windows.
