	Utility to start http servers on all interfaces.  All servers are
	started listening on the given port.

	Returns a tuple of (server, thread) tuples, one for each http
	server started by the function.  The servers are
	bottle.WSGIRefServer instances, the threads are threading.Thread
	instances.  NOTE:  the return value should be considered an opaque
	object, we reserver the right to switch to a different server
	system in the future.

	httpd_stop() is registered as a Python atexit handler for each
	server started by this function, so it is not normally necessary to
	explicitly stop the servers;  they will be automatically shutdown
	when the application exits.
