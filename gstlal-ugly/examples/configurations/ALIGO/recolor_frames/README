You always have to setup your environment to use the correct gstlal / lalsuite
code from git.

1) Disable the lscsoft installation.  Also make sure you don't have anything
unusual (including other lalsuite/gstlal/gstreamer installations) set up by
default at login.

 $ touch .nolscsoft

2) Only a few variables need to be set. Here you will setup only the lscsoft
packages that you need.  I build lalsuite and gstlal to a directory called
gstlocal, with _no_ subdirectories.  You should do whatever you are comfortable
with, but I highly recommend simplicity. For comparison here is my environment
script between the lines below:

________________________________________________________________________________________________
for p in libframe gst libmetaio
       do
       PATH=/opt/lscsoft/${p}/bin:$PATH
       PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/lscsoft/${p}/lib64/pkgconfig:/opt/lscsoft/${p}/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
       PYTHONPATH=/opt/lscsoft/${p}/lib64/python2.4/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
       done

# This is an install prefix that does not get used anywhere but this script!!!
INSTALLPATH=${HOME}/gstlocal

# These are environment variables that do get exported
PATH=${INSTALLPATH}/bin:$PATH
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${INSTALLPATH}/lib64/pkgconfig:${INSTALLPATH}/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
PYTHONPATH=${INSTALLPATH}/lib64/python2.4/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
GST_PLUGIN_PATH=${INSTALLPATH}/lib/gstreamer-0.10:${GST_PLUGIN_PATH}
source ~cbc/opt/sqlite/etc/sqliterc

export PATH PKG_CONFIG_PATH PYTHONPATH GST_PLUGIN_PATH
________________________________________________________________________________________________

NOTE: There is a bug in libmetaio package distributed in lscsoft that may cause
a segfault.  If you encounter a segfault from metaio then you will need to
build your own metaio from source and adjust your environment script to not use
the system wide one.  We are working to fix the installed version.

3) Clone the repositories if you don't have them already
 $ git clone albert.einstein@ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu:/usr/local/git/gstlal.git
 $ git clone albert.einstein@ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu:/usr/local/git/lalsuite.git

4) build lalsuite to the prefix you used in your environment script!!

5) in gstlal setup a remote tracking branch for 'pbh'.  

 $ git checkout -b pbh origin/pbh

6) Build gstlal to the same prefix as lalsuite.

# Recoloring frames
###############################################################################

Make a directory for recoloring the frames and copy this entire direcory's contents to it.

1) edit the Makefile as appropriate
2) run
  $ make -j
3) submit the resulting dag
  $ condor_submit_dag recolor_pipe.dag
