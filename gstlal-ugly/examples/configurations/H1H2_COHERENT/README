This is a pipeline that produces frame files for the LHO coherent and null streams.  

H1 and H2 frame cache files have been included in this directory, because these cache files contain long segments during which both H1 and H2 were on.

To run the pipeline from this directory:

python coh_null_h1h2.py --frame-cache-H1=H1.cache --frame-cache-H2=H2.cache --gps-start-time=870008619 --gps-end-time=870009619 --verbose

To run the pipeline and write the pipeline graph to this directory:

GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR=. python coh_null_h1h2.py --frame-cache-H1=H1.cache --frame-cache-H2=H2.cache --gps-start-time=870008619 --gps-end-time=870009619 --verbose --write-pipeline="LHO_COH_NULL"
